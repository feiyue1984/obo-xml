This prototype is quite simple with regard to the functionality and UI design. There is a button to initiate the program, a treeview to display the data and at the bottom there is a status bar to show progress.

To start the program, just click on the only button of the window. Then, the XML data file will be parsed and loaded into memory. Depending on the hardware, this phase takes up to several seconds. 

A treeview will be constructed based on the <term>xxx</term> tags in the file. Each TERM tag becomes the immediate child of the root of the tree and the id property of the term will be displayed at this level. Initially all nodes are collapsed and the only visible information of each node is the id. The details of each node are displayed in subnodes, which are loaded just in time when the node is expanded by user.

If a node bears a subnode 'is_a : GO:${id}', by clicking this subnode, the treeview will scroll the node referenced by this id and highlight it.

To shutdown the program, just click 'X' button of the window.
